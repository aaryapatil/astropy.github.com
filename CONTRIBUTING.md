# Modifying Roles in the Team section

* Modify the `roles.json` file
* Preview locally by opening `team.html` in your browser. Note that most browsers restrict local file access (needed to access your local copy of `roles.json`), so you'll need to configure your browser to allow this - details depend on the browser, but usually you find it in some sort of "developer" menu.
