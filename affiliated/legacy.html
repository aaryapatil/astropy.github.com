	<h1 id="legacy-affiliated-packages">Legacy Page: Pre-APE 22<a class="paralink" href="#legacy-affiliated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<p>This page contains the legacy process and listing of Astropy Affiliated Packages
that pre-dated <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE22.rst">APE 22</a>.
This page is frozen as of March 6, 2024.</p>

	<h1 id="affiliated-packages">Astropy Affiliated Packages<a class="paralink" href="#affiliated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>A major part of the Astropy Project is the concept of “Astropy
	affiliated packages”. An affiliated package is an astronomy-related Python
    package that is not part of the astropy core package, and is not managed by
    the project but is a part of the Astropy Project community. These packages
    demonstrate a commitment to Astropy’s goals of improving reuse,
    interoperability, and interface standards for Python astronomy and
    astrophysics packages.  In many (but not all) cases, affiliated packages
    also follow similar development processes and package templates as for the
    core package.</p>

	<p>If you are a developer interested in signing up as an affiliated package,
	details are in the <a href="#affiliated-instructions">Becoming an
	Affiliated Package</a> section.</p>

	<h1 id="coordinated-packages">Astropy Coordinated Packages<a class="paralink" href="#coordinated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>A related concept is that of “Astropy coordinated packages”. Coordinated
	packages are similar to affiliated packages, but the Astropy Project as a
	whole maintains them.  In practice this means the Astropy coordination
	committee has administrative control of a coordinated package repository
	(delegated to the maintainers), and that maintainers of these packages have
	<a href="../team.html"> formal roles</a> in the Astropy Project.  The most
    prominent of these coordinated packages is the Astropy core package itself.
    In some cases these are packages identified by the core team as needing
    development separate from the core (either they are experimental or problem
    space-focused), while others started as affiliated packages but have become
    so important to the ecosystem that they grew to become coordinated.</p>

	<h1 id="infrastructure-packages">Astropy Infrastructure Packages<a class="paralink" href="#infrastructure-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>One final related category are the "Astropy infrastructure packages".
	These packages are those that are necessary infrastructure for Astropy
	packages - e.g. testing and documentation machinery.  While occasionally
	these have astro-specific functionality, in general they are more generic
	packages that are useful to packages outside of astronomy, and as a result
	may have some maintainers outside the Astropy project. But some are also
	Astropy coordinated packages, with maintainers drawn from the infrastructure
	roles.

	<section id="installing">

	<h1 id="installing-affiliated-packages">Installing Affiliated and Coordinated Packages<a class="paralink" href="#installing-affiliated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>  The simplest way to install and keep up-to-date most affiliated packages is to use the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda">Anaconda python distribution</a>.  This distribution includes the <a href="http://astropy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Astropy core package</a> already built in, and you can then easily install or update affiliated packages using the <a href="https://anaconda.org/astropy/packages">Astropy Conda channel</a> of binary installable packages.  Once you have Anaconda installed, you can do <code>conda search --channel astropy some_affiliated_package</code>.  Most importantly, you can then install them with <code>conda install --channel astropy some_affiliated_package</code>.  The Astropy channel is maintained by the Astropy Project on Github via code in the <a href="https://github.com/astropy/conda-channel-astropy">conda-channel-astropy</a> repository. </p>

	<p> If you do not have Anaconda or wish to install from source, for most affiliated packages, downloading the source code and doing <code>python setup.py install</code> will work.  Many also support the Astropy core package's additional build and install options, as they use the affiliated package template (detailed more in the <a href="#affiliated-instructions">Becoming an Affiliated Package</a> section). That said, affiliated packages are developed independently of the Astropy core library.  This means they are free to develop their packages as they see fit, and can have a variety of different requirements or  unusual install procedures.  Hence you should refer to the package's documentation first if you encounter problems.</p>

	<h1 id="becoming-an-affiliated-package">Becoming an Affiliated Package<a class="paralink" href="#becoming-an-affiliated-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>If you are a developer of an astronomy package and would like your package
	to become affiliated with the Astropy Project, please take a look at the
	<a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/affiliated/affiliated_package_review_process.md#proposing-an-affiliated-package">
  instructions for proposing an affiliated package</a>. We recommend that you
	also take a look at the
	<a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/affiliated/affiliated_package_review_guidelines.md">
	guidelines for reviewing affiliated packages</a> since this will give you a
	sense of whether your package is ready for review. Broadly speaking, your
	package should:</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Be potentially useful to astronomers.  This can mean useful to a
		specific sub-domain of astronomy, or more broadly useful to a large
		fraction of astronomy (or beyond, as long as it is also useful for
		astronomy).</li>

		<li>Specifically use, interface with, or provide complementary capabilities
		  to other Astropy packages.</li>

		<li>Be written in a way that is readable and understandable by others. While
		not a strict requirement, we also provide <a
		href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/codeguide.html">coding
		guidelines</a> that will make your code easier to read by members of the
		community.</li>

		<li>Use <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/">classes and functions from the
		astropy core package</a> wherever possible and appropriate, and (as much as
		possible) avoid duplication with other packages in the Astropy ecosystem.
		This facilitates re-use of code and sharing of resources.</li>

		<li>Have documentation that adequately explains the use
		of the package. Additionally,
		user-facing classes and functions should all have docstrings. We suggest
		using sphinx, with the numpydoc-like <a
		href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/docguide.html">docstring
		standards used by astropy</a>, but this is not a strict requirement as long
		as the documentation is of comparable quality.</li>

		<li>Make a best-effort to include an easy-to-run test
		suite that covers its intended functionality. We realize this is not always
		possible, but when it is, a test suite is a crucial element of stable
		software and reproducible science.</li>

		<li>Use Python 3.x. Packages are allowed to be 2.x compatible, but must support recent versions of Python 3.x.</li>

		<li>Be open to contributions from others. While this most straightforwardly
		means it follows a Github-based open development model (like the Astropy core
		package), alternative approaches are perfectly valid as long as they are
		consistent with basic principles of open source. (E.g.,
		<a href="https://choosealicense.com/">an OSI-approved license</a>)</li>

		<li>Include instructions to users on how to cite your package. This is commonly done
			with a CITATION file. This file could include a Zenodo record (highly recommended),
			acknowledgement text, and/or journal article(s). Where possible, full BibTeX entries of these citations
			are recommended. </li>

		<li>Include citations to other relevant papers and software following
			<a href="https://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2019/07/01/citing-astronomy-software-inline-text-examples/">leading
				practices for citing astronomy software</a>.</li>

	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>In addition, you should make an effort to connect with the Astropy
	developer community, including developers from the core astropy package or
	any related affiliated packages. If your package is determined to meet the above
	standards, it will be accepted and added to the affiliated package registry.
	Note however that if packages become unmaintained or do not meet the standards
	anymore, they may be removed from the list of affiliated packages.</p>

	<h2 id="package-template">Package Template<a class="paralink" href="#package-template" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
	<p>If you are considering creating a new astronomy package and would like it
	to be an Astropy affiliated package, you can use <a href="https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/packaging-guide">the OpenAstronomy packaging guide</a> to
	make it much easier to meet these standards. It reflects up-to-date Python packaging techniques
	to generate documentation like that used in the astropy package, a
	ready-to-use testing framework, and a variety of tools that streamline tasks
	like user configuration, caching downloaded files, or linking C-compiled
	extensions. More details on this template are available in the <a
	href="https://packaging-guide.openastronomy.org/en/latest/#using-the-template">usage
	instructions for the template</a>.
	</p>
<p>We recommend that you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/astropy-affiliated-maintainers">astropy-affiliated-maintainers</a> mailing list to be kept informed of updates to the package template, as well as to have any dicussions related to setting up affiliated packages.</p>
